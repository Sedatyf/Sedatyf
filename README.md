### Hi there 👋

I'm using C# for my work and I also know Python. I'm used to code in Java. I recently learned Javascript.
I'm interested in a lot of topics in IT like cybersecurity, DevOps, coding, etc. as you can see on my projects listed below:
- I made some beginner cybersecurity scripts in Python like ARP Spoofing
- I made some Python scripts and Python apps for learning purposes and for fun
- In a near futur I'd like to do some DevOps project
- I also want to learn front end dev
- I am currently into Three.js as I want to do 3D in Blender again
