### Hi there

I'm using Java for my work and I recently learned Python. 
I'm interested in a lot of topics in IT like cybersecurity, DevOps, coding, etc. as you can see on my projects listed below:
- I made some cybersecurity 
- I made some Python scripts for learning purposes. Recently, I'm trying to learn PySide
- Right now, Iâ€™m currently contributing on [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore) as a game tester and maybe, I'll try to contribute on patching Database.
